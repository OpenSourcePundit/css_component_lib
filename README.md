# CSS Component Library - OSP Components

Welcome to the OSP-Components component library! This library provides pre-styled CSS classes that you can use in your React applications to quickly style your components.

## Installation

To use the OSP-Components component library in your React application, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the library:

```bash
npm install css_component_lib
```

### 2. Import the CSS file into your React application:

In your React component files where you want to use the styles from the library, import the styles.css file from the installed package. This step ensures that the styles are included in your application and can be used across your components.

```bash
import 'css_component_lib/styles.css'

```

### 3. Use the CSS classes in your components:

You can use the CSS classes defined in styles.css directly in your JSX. These classes provide pre-styled elements that you can use to quickly style your components without writing custom CSS.

```bash
<div className="your-css-class">
  {/* Your component content */}
</div>
```
